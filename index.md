## About me

* An average European, living in Prague.
* A programmer (sometimes a computer magician, working with all colours of
  magic, including black).
* A climber. Maybe I'll write a post comparing Rust to climbing one day.
* I suffer from chronic lack of free time.
* Huge fan of the „Ha ha only serious“ attitude.
* And yes, self-appointed member of the Rust Evangelism Strike Force.

## About the pages

These were thrown together quite fast (see above to know why). I also do have my
[personal web pages](https://vorner.cz/en), but they are really outdated and
fell into disrepair. You can have a look, if you really like a retro design. So
I decided not to use them for now, before I get around to doing something with
them.

This is here mostly for the technical stuff (like Rust).
